Given a face $f$ of the original link diagram the \emph{augmentation sequence}
of $f$, denoted $\sigma_f$, is a cyclical sequence of symbols $0, L, R$ indexed
by vertices of $f$ going counter-clockwise, where, for $v \in \partial f$, the
$v$-th element is
\[
\sigma_f^v = 
\begin{cases}
0 \text{ if $v$ is not augmented} \\
L \text{ if $v$ is left-augmented} \\
R \text{ if $v$ is right-augmented}
\end{cases}
\]

%\begin{theorem}
%Let $K$ be a weakly prime, alternating link with diagram $D$ with no bigons. Let
%$L$ be a link obtained from augmenting $K$ such that there exist no sequence of
%augmentations where a Left augmentation is adjacent to a Right augmentation.
%Then $L$ is hyperbolic.
%\end{theorem}
old proof of main theorem:
\begin{proof}
By \cite[Theorem 7.5]{CKP2},
$\toruscomp{K}$ can be decomposed
into two torihedra whose graphs are the projection graph of $K$,
which we denote by $\Gamma$.
By assigning angles $\pi/2$ to each edge of the torihedra graphs,
we can invoke \cite[Theorem 3]{BandS} to give us a circle pattern
on the projection graph.

By \prpref{p:tori_decomp}, $\toruscomp{L}$ can be
obtained by gluing two torihedra with graph $\Gamma_T(L)$ and $\Gamma_B(L)$.
Recall that $\Gamma_T(L)$ is obtained from $\Gamma$ by some slight
modifications, specifically by replacing augmented vertices with bow-ties.
We assign angles to edges of the bow-ties as in
\figref{f:bowtie_angles},
and leave untouched edges with the same assignment of $\pi/2$;
we do the same for $\Gamma_B(L)$.

(Hmmm... might be misleading, I think $\Psi$ should be a cellular map
$\Gamma_T(L) \to \Gamma_T(K)$, but the latter happens to be
same as $\Gamma$, so that's why it's confusing!)
We can think of a bow-tie in $\Gamma_T(L)$ as ``thickened edges" in the
following sense: consider the bow-tie at a crossing $v$,
and let the edges $e,e'$ of $\Gamma$ at $v$
be associated to the over-strand of $K$.
There is a cellular map from each triangle of the bow-tie
on to $e, e'$ that identifies the $\pi/2$- and 0-labeled edges,
and collapses the $\pi$-labeled edges onto $v$
(TODO see same figure).
It is not hard to see that this map extends to a cellular map
$\Psi: \Gamma_T(L) \to \Gamma$,
and in fact extends to the faces as well.
A similar story applies to $\Gamma_B$.


Now we construct an extended circle pattern for $\Gamma_T(L)$.
We will give a more precise description,
but let us first give the picture.
Under $\Psi$,
each face $f$ of $\Gamma_T(L)$ that is not in a bow-tie
is identified with a face $\bar{f}$ of $\Gamma$,
so we assign the circle of $\bar{f}$ to $f$;
each triangle face $f$ in a bow-tie is collapsed to an edge,
and we assign to $f$ the circle circumscribing the
face of $\Gamma$ that meets $f$ along the 0-labeled edge.
This is a ``degenerate" circle pattern that can be thought of as
the limit of some (singular) circle patterns.


Let us make this more precise,
describing an extended circle pattern $c$
on $\Gamma_T(L)$.
Let the circle pattern for $\Gamma$ be given by
$\bar{c} = ((r_f),(\vphi_{\vec{e}}))$,
where recall $r_f$ is the radius of the circle $C_f$
circumscribing $f$ and $\vphi_{\vec{e}}$
is half the angle subtended by the edge $e$
at the center of $C_f$.
For non-bow-tie faces $f$ of $\Gamma_T(L)$,
$\Psi$ identifies $f$ with the face $\bar{f}$ of $\Gamma$.
We set $r_f(c) = r_{\bar{f}}(\bar{c})$.
For $\vphi$ of its edges,
if $\vec{e} \in \del f$ is labeled $\pi$,
we set $\vphi_{\vec{e}} = 0$;
otherwise, $\Psi$ identifies $\vec{e}$
with the edge $\vec{e}'$ in $\Gamma$,
then we set $\vphi_{\vec{e}}(c) = \vphi_{\vec{e}'}(\bar{c})$.


For a triangular face $f$ of a bow tie,
let $\vec{e}_0, \vec{e}_{\pi/2}, \vec{e}_{\pi}$
be the edges of $f$ labeled $0,\pi/2, \pi$ respectively.
We set $r_f(c) = r_{f'}(c)$,
where $f'$ is the face adjacent to $f$ across $e_0$.
Then we set
$\vphi_{\vec{e}_{\pi/2}} = \vphi_{\cev{e}_0} = \pi - \vphi_{\vec{e}_0}$
and $\vphi_{\vec{e}_{\pi}} = 0$.


It can be easily checked that $c$ satisfies the conditions of
\prpref{p:nghd_lift}.
We would like to apply \lemref{l:circpattern_polyhedra}
to obtain a polyhedral decomposition of the torihedra,
but there are edges with $\vphi_{\vec{e}}$
(specifically, those with $\theta_e = \pi$).
%We want a deformation of $\theta_{\bullet}$ of $c$
%that remains vertex non-singular,
%and gives us an honest ?? circle pattern.
Hence, we want to find a vector $a = \sum a^e \ddd{\theta_e}$
in the tangent space of $\Theta(c)$
that maintains vertex non-singularity,
i.e.  such that $\sum_{e \ni v} a^e = 0$ for all vertices $v$,
and for edges $e$ with $\theta_e = \pi$,
we have $a^e < 0$.
By \prpref{p:nghd_lift}, there exists $\veps > 0$
such that the path $\gamma(t) = \Theta(c) + t \cdot a$, $t\in [0,\veps]$,
in $\TTT$ can be lifted to a path $\tilde{\gamma}$ in $\CCC$.


To find such $a$, we need to modify $\Gamma_T(L)$ by
cutting faces along new edges.
Consider a face $f$ that is not in a bow-tie.
Suppose the corresponding face $\bar{f}$ of $\Gamma$
had vertices $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ in counter-clockwise order.
Suppose it is the case that if a vertex $v_i$ is left-augmented,
then the augmentation circle intersects $\bar{f}$
(everything is similar if it is right-augmented circles that intersect
$\bar{f}$).
Vertex $v_i$ corresponds to one edge $e_i$ of $\Gamma_T(L)$
if $v_i$ is not augmented or right-augmented,
and corresponds to two edges $e_{i,0}, e_{i,\pi}$
of $\Gamma_T(L)$ if $v_i$ is left-augmented
($e_{i,0}, e_{i,\pi}$ are edges of a single bow-tie,
and $e_{i,0}$ has $\theta_{e_{i,0}} = 0$
and $e_{i,\pi}$ has $\theta_{e_{i,\pi}} = \pi$).


Suppose, after cyclically reindexing, $v_1,\ldots,v_k$
is a maximally contiguous subsequence of left-augmented vertices
of $G(K)$ around the face $\bar{f}$;
the edges around $f$ would start
$e_{1,0}, e_{1,\pi}, e_{2,0}, e_{2,\pi}, \ldots$.
We add new edges across $f$ as follows.

First suppose $k=n$; then we do nothing.

Next suppose there is only one such maximal contiguous subsequence.
If $k = 1$, we add an edge that goes across
$e_{1,0},e_{1,\pi},e_2$
(in the sense that the new edge separates the edges of $f$ into two sets
one of them being those three edges;
since $n\geq 3$, this edge is new).
If $k = 2$, we add edge across $e_{1,0},e_{1,\pi}$
and another edge across $e_{2,0},e_{2,\pi}$
(these two edges do not form a bigon because we've ruled out $k=n$).
If $k \geq 3$,
we add an edge across $e_{1,0},e_{1,\pi},e_{2,0}$
and another edge across $e_{2,\pi},e_{3,0},\ldots,e_{k,\pi}$
(again these two edges do not form a bigon).

Finally, if there are multiple such maximal contiguous subsequences,
we just add edges as above for each contiguous subsequence.
The only caveat is that if the procedure calls to add a new edge
that would form a bigon with the existing edges,
we just don't add it.

See \figref{f:adding_edges}

TODO CONTINUE HERE do the $+$ and $-$ on the edges.




Our torihedral decomposition has graph and on augmentation we will give 0 and pi angles. Next we add another edge and give blah angle (we have three cases)
do three cases with pictures

part 3: Use proposition to get circle pattern to get polyhedral decomposition of the link 

part 4: get triangulation.

\begin{prop}
Suppose $L$ is obtained from augmenting $K$,
so that for each face $f$ of the link projection of $K$,
the augmentation sequence $\sigma_f$ has no $L$ adjacent to $R$.

\begin{prop}
Let $\Sigma$ be a closed surface with a cellular decomposition.
Suppose we have labeled some edges by either $`+'$ or $`-'$,
such that for each face $f$,
\begin{itemize}
	\item no two adjacent edges have the same label,
	\item the length of consecutive labeled edges is at least 2.
\end{itemize}
Then one can further decompose faces along new edges,
and extend the labelling of edges,
such that every vertex is adjacent to the same number of
$`+'$'s and $`-'$'s.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Consider a face $f$ and consider a maximal contiguous sequence
of labeled edges, $e_1,\ldots,e_k$ in $\del f$.
they span the vertices $v_0,\ldots,v_k$.
Suppose $e_1$ is labeled $`+'$ (the other case is similar).
Then $e_2$ is labeled $`-'$, $e_3$ is $`+'$, and so on.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Case 1}: $k$ is odd. Then we cut $f$ along a new edge
$\overline{v_0 v_k}$, and label this edge by $`-'$.

\textbf{Case 2}: $k = 2$ and . Then we cut $f$ along a new edge
\end{proof}

%Then by results of \cite{BandS} there exist a corresponding
%right-angled circle pattern. We then consider the augmented link $L$ and its
%torihedral decomposition from Proposition \ref{p:tori_decomp} with a
%corresponding ``degenerate" circle pattern. We deform this degenerate circle
%pattern into a ``proper" circle pattern which will give us a polyhedral
%decomposition of $(\torus \times I)-L$ with angles of the torihedra in our
%torihedral decomposition. Which we can further decompose into tetrahedra with
%angles satisfying conditions of an angle structure.
