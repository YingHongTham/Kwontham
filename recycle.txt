%\begin{theorem}
%Let $K$ be a weakly prime, alternating link with diagram $D$ with no bigons. Let
%$L$ be a link obtained from augmenting $K$ such that there exist no sequence of
%augmentations where a Left augmentation is adjacent to a Right augmentation.
%Then $L$ is hyperbolic.
%\end{theorem}
old proof of main theorem:
\begin{proof}
By \cite[Theorem 7.5]{CKP2},
$\toruscomp{K}$ can be decomposed
into two torihedra whose graphs are the projection graph of $K$,
which we denote by $\Gamma$.
By assigning angles $\pi/2$ to each edge of the torihedra graphs,
we can invoke \cite[Theorem 3]{BandS} to give us a circle pattern
on the projection graph.

By \prpref{p:tori_decomp}, $\toruscomp{L}$ can be
obtained by gluing two torihedra with graph $\Gamma_T(L)$ and $\Gamma_B(L)$.
Recall that $\Gamma_T(L)$ is obtained from $\Gamma$ by some slight
modifications, specifically by replacing augmented vertices with bow-ties.
We assign angles to edges of the bow-ties as in
\figref{f:bowtie_angles},
and leave untouched edges with the same assignment of $\pi/2$;
we do the same for $\Gamma_B(L)$.

(Hmmm... might be misleading, I think $\Psi$ should be a cellular map
$\Gamma_T(L) \to \Gamma_T(K)$, but the latter happens to be
same as $\Gamma$, so that's why it's confusing!)
We can think of a bow-tie in $\Gamma_T(L)$ as ``thickened edges" in the
following sense: consider the bow-tie at a crossing $v$,
and let the edges $e,e'$ of $\Gamma$ at $v$
be associated to the over-strand of $K$.
There is a cellular map from each triangle of the bow-tie
on to $e, e'$ that identifies the $\pi/2$- and 0-labeled edges,
and collapses the $\pi$-labeled edges onto $v$
(TODO see same figure).
It is not hard to see that this map extends to a cellular map
$\Psi: \Gamma_T(L) \to \Gamma$,
and in fact extends to the faces as well.
A similar story applies to $\Gamma_B$.


Now we construct an extended circle pattern for $\Gamma_T(L)$.
We will give a more precise description,
but let us first give the picture.
Under $\Psi$,
each face $f$ of $\Gamma_T(L)$ that is not in a bow-tie
is identified with a face $\bar{f}$ of $\Gamma$,
so we assign the circle of $\bar{f}$ to $f$;
each triangle face $f$ in a bow-tie is collapsed to an edge,
and we assign to $f$ the circle circumscribing the
face of $\Gamma$ that meets $f$ along the 0-labeled edge.
This is a ``degenerate" circle pattern that can be thought of as
the limit of some (singular) circle patterns.


Let us make this more precise,
describing an extended circle pattern $c$
on $\Gamma_T(L)$.
Let the circle pattern for $\Gamma$ be given by
$\bar{c} = ((r_f),(\vphi_{\vec{e}}))$,
where recall $r_f$ is the radius of the circle $C_f$
circumscribing $f$ and $\vphi_{\vec{e}}$
is half the angle subtended by the edge $e$
at the center of $C_f$.
For non-bow-tie faces $f$ of $\Gamma_T(L)$,
$\Psi$ identifies $f$ with the face $\bar{f}$ of $\Gamma$.
We set $r_f(c) = r_{\bar{f}}(\bar{c})$.
For $\vphi$ of its edges,
if $\vec{e} \in \del f$ is labeled $\pi$,
we set $\vphi_{\vec{e}} = 0$;
otherwise, $\Psi$ identifies $\vec{e}$
with the edge $\vec{e}'$ in $\Gamma$,
then we set $\vphi_{\vec{e}}(c) = \vphi_{\vec{e}'}(\bar{c})$.


For a triangular face $f$ of a bow tie,
let $\vec{e}_0, \vec{e}_{\pi/2}, \vec{e}_{\pi}$
be the edges of $f$ labeled $0,\pi/2, \pi$ respectively.
We set $r_f(c) = r_{f'}(c)$,
where $f'$ is the face adjacent to $f$ across $e_0$.
Then we set
$\vphi_{\vec{e}_{\pi/2}} = \vphi_{\cev{e}_0} = \pi - \vphi_{\vec{e}_0}$
and $\vphi_{\vec{e}_{\pi}} = 0$.


It can be easily checked that $c$ satisfies the conditions of
\prpref{p:nghd_lift}.
We would like to apply \lemref{l:circpattern_polyhedra}
to obtain a polyhedral decomposition of the torihedra,
but there are edges with $\vphi_{\vec{e}}$
(specifically, those with $\theta_e = \pi$).
%We want a deformation of $\theta_{\bullet}$ of $c$
%that remains vertex non-singular,
%and gives us an honest ?? circle pattern.
Hence, we want to find a vector $a = \sum a^e \ddd{\theta_e}$
in the tangent space of $\Theta(c)$
that maintains vertex non-singularity,
i.e.  such that $\sum_{e \ni v} a^e = 0$ for all vertices $v$,
and for edges $e$ with $\theta_e = \pi$,
we have $a^e < 0$.
By \prpref{p:nghd_lift}, there exists $\veps > 0$
such that the path $\gamma(t) = \Theta(c) + t \cdot a$, $t\in [0,\veps]$,
in $\TTT$ can be lifted to a path $\tilde{\gamma}$ in $\CCC$.


To find such $a$, we need to modify $\Gamma_T(L)$ by
cutting faces along new edges.
Consider a face $f$ that is not in a bow-tie.
Suppose the corresponding face $\bar{f}$ of $\Gamma$
had vertices $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ in counter-clockwise order.
Suppose it is the case that if a vertex $v_i$ is left-augmented,
then the augmentation circle intersects $\bar{f}$
(everything is similar if it is right-augmented circles that intersect
$\bar{f}$).
Vertex $v_i$ corresponds to one edge $e_i$ of $\Gamma_T(L)$
if $v_i$ is not augmented or right-augmented,
and corresponds to two edges $e_{i,0}, e_{i,\pi}$
of $\Gamma_T(L)$ if $v_i$ is left-augmented
($e_{i,0}, e_{i,\pi}$ are edges of a single bow-tie,
and $e_{i,0}$ has $\theta_{e_{i,0}} = 0$
and $e_{i,\pi}$ has $\theta_{e_{i,\pi}} = \pi$).


Suppose, after cyclically reindexing, $v_1,\ldots,v_k$
is a maximally contiguous subsequence of left-augmented vertices
of $G(K)$ around the face $\bar{f}$;
the edges around $f$ would start
$e_{1,0}, e_{1,\pi}, e_{2,0}, e_{2,\pi}, \ldots$.
We add new edges across $f$ as follows.

First suppose $k=n$; then we do nothing.

Next suppose there is only one such maximal contiguous subsequence.
If $k = 1$, we add an edge that goes across
$e_{1,0},e_{1,\pi},e_2$
(in the sense that the new edge separates the edges of $f$ into two sets
one of them being those three edges;
since $n\geq 3$, this edge is new).
If $k = 2$, we add edge across $e_{1,0},e_{1,\pi}$
and another edge across $e_{2,0},e_{2,\pi}$
(these two edges do not form a bigon because we've ruled out $k=n$).
If $k \geq 3$,
we add an edge across $e_{1,0},e_{1,\pi},e_{2,0}$
and another edge across $e_{2,\pi},e_{3,0},\ldots,e_{k,\pi}$
(again these two edges do not form a bigon).

Finally, if there are multiple such maximal contiguous subsequences,
we just add edges as above for each contiguous subsequence.
The only caveat is that if the procedure calls to add a new edge
that would form a bigon with the existing edges,
we just don't add it.

See \figref{f:adding_edges}

Our torihedral decomposition has graph and on augmentation we will give 0 and pi angles. Next we add another edge and give blah angle (we have three cases)

\begin{prop}
Let $\Sigma$ be a closed surface with a cellular decomposition.
Suppose we have labeled some edges by either $`+'$ or $`-'$,
such that for each face $f$,
\begin{itemize}
	\item no two adjacent edges have the same label,
	\item the length of consecutive labeled edges is at least 2.
\end{itemize}
Then one can further decompose faces along new edges,
and extend the labelling of edges,
such that every vertex is adjacent to the same number of
$`+'$'s and $`-'$'s.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Consider a face $f$ and consider a maximal contiguous sequence
of labeled edges, $e_1,\ldots,e_k$ in $\del f$.
they span the vertices $v_0,\ldots,v_k$.
Suppose $e_1$ is labeled $`+'$ (the other case is similar).
Then $e_2$ is labeled $`-'$, $e_3$ is $`+'$, and so on.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Case 1}: $k$ is odd. Then we cut $f$ along a new edge
$\overline{v_0 v_k}$, and label this edge by $`-'$.

\textbf{Case 2}: $k = 2$ and . Then we cut $f$ along a new edge
\end{proof}

%Then by results of \cite{BandS} there exist a corresponding
%right-angled circle pattern. We then consider the augmented link $L$ and its
%torihedral decomposition from Proposition \ref{p:tori_decomp} with a
%corresponding ``degenerate" circle pattern. We deform this degenerate circle
%pattern into a ``proper" circle pattern which will give us a polyhedral
%decomposition of $(\torus \times I)-L$ with angles of the torihedra in our
%torihedral decomposition. Which we can further decompose into tetrahedra with
%angles satisfying conditions of an angle structure. 





\begin{lemma}
Let $c$ be an extended circle pattern whose faces are either
convex or thin.
Then $\CCC$ is a manifold in a neighborhood of $c$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
$d(l_{\vec{e}} - l_{\cev{e}})
= \sin \vphi_{\vec{e}} d r_{f_{\vec{e}}}
+ r_{f_{\vec{e}}} \cos \vphi_{\vec{e}} d \vphi_{\vec{e}}
- \sin \vphi_{\cev{e}} d r_{f_{\cev{e}}}
- r_{f_{\cev{e}}} \cos \vphi_{\cev{e}} d \vphi_{\cev{e}}
$,
and since having only convex of thin faces implies
$\cos \vphi_{\vec{e}} \neq 0$ for all $\vec{e}$,
we see that the differentials $d(l_{\vec{e}} - l_{\cev{e}})$
are linearly independent at $c$,
hence are linearly independent in a neighborhood of $c$.
%Thus, by the implicit function theorem,
%$\CCC$ is a manifold in a neighborhood of $c$.
\end{proof}





To illustrate the main idea of the construction,
first suppose that $e$ is an edge between two convex faces $f, f'$
(so $\vec{e} \in \del f, \cev{e} \in \del f'$).
Observe that %$\alpha_e$ from \eqnref{e:alpha_e}
\begin{equation}
\label{e:alpha_e}
\alpha_e = \frac{1}{2 r_f \cos \vphi_{\vec{e}}} \ddd{\vphi_{\vec{e}}}
+ \frac{1}{2 r_{f'}\cos \vphi_{\cev{e}}} \ddd{\vphi_{\cev{e}}}
\end{equation}
increases both $l_{\vec{e}}$ and $l_{\cev{e}}$ at the same rate,
and has the side effect of
increasing $\Phi_f$ and $\Phi_{f'}$.
We can compensate using $\beta_f$ from \eqnref{e:beta_f_convex},
so we consider
\[
w_e = \alpha_e - \frac{1}{\cos \vphi_{\vec{e}}} \beta_f
	- \frac{1}{\cos \vphi_{\cev{e}}} \beta_{f'} \in K_c
\]
%Since $\theta_e = \pi - \vphi_{\vec{e}} - \vphi_{\cev{e}}$,
%we need to show that the coefficients of $\ddd{\vphi_{\vec{e}}},
%\ddd{\vphi_{\cev{e}}}$ sum to 0.
For $\vec{e'} \in \del f \cup \del f' \backslash \{\vec{e},\cev{e}\}$,
the $\ddd{\vphi_{\vec{e'}}}$ component only appears in $\beta_f$
or $\beta_{f'}$, which is positive by construciton
(because $f,f'$ are convex faces);
thus, $d\theta_{e'}(w_e) \geq 0$ for such $e'$, and
is equal to 0 if and only if $e'$ is short.
Finally, since $w_e \in K_c$, it leaves the sum $\sum_{e\in E} \theta_e$
constant, so $d\theta_e(w_e) < 0$, so we can take
\begin{equation}
\label{e:u_e}
u_e := (d\theta_e(w_e))^\inv \cdot w_e
\end{equation}

Next we consider the presence of thick faces that are not convex,
but still assume there are no thin faces.
Then a thick face as at most one edge with $\vphi_{\vec{e}} \geq \pi/2$.
Suppose $\vec{e} \in \del f$, and $f$ is not convex.
We want to increase $l_{\vec{e}}$ as before.
If $f$ has no edges with $\vphi_\bullet = \pi/2$,
then we consider
\begin{equation}
\gamma_f = \ddd{\vphi_{\vec{e}}} - \ddd{\vphi_{\vec{e'}}}
\end{equation}
where $e'$ is some other edge of $f$, such that
$\max \{\vphi_{\vec{e}}, \vphi_{\vec{e'}}\} > \pi/2$.
Because $\cos \vphi_{\vec{e}} \neq 0 \cos \vphi_{\vec{e'}}$,
$\gamma_f$ affects both $l_{\vec{e}}$ and $l_{\vec{e'}}$
(increasing or decreasing both simultaneously)
while keeping $\Phi_f$ constant.
This allows us to ``transfer'' the effect of increasing $l_{\vec{e}}$
to $l_{\vec{e'}}$, in the following sense:
if $e'$ is adjacent to another face $f''$ that is convex,
then 



Old proof of main first order deformation result:
\begin{proof}[Proof of \prpref{p:point_lift}]
We construct a vector $u_e \in K_c \subseteq T_c \CCC$ for each edge $e$
and show that $\{\Theta_*(u_e)\}_{e\in E}$ spans an
$|E|-1$ dimensional space,
thus must be equal $L_{\Theta_c}$.


For long edges $e$, $u_e$ will have the following property:
if $\Theta_*(u_e) = \sum_{e' \in E} a^{e'} \ddd{\theta_{e'}}$, then
\begin{itemize}
	\item $a^e = 1$;
	\item $a^{e'} \leq 0$ for all $e' \neq e$;
	\item $a^{e'} = 0$ for short edges $e'$.
	\item $\sum_{e' \in E} a^{e'} = 0$ (follows directly from $u_e \in K_c$)
\end{itemize}
Furthermore, these $u_e$'s collectively satisfy the following
connectivity property:
consider the graph $G_\llong$ whose vertex set is the set of long edges,
and we connect two long edges $e,e'$ by an edge if there is some $e''$ such that
$a^e, a^{e'}$ are both nonzero in $\Theta_*(u_{e''})$;
then $G_\llong$ is connected.

In addition, for short edges $e$,
$u_e$ have the following property: again writing
$\Theta_*(u_e) = \sum_{e' \in E} a^{e'} \ddd{\theta_{e'}}$,
one has
\begin{itemize}
	\item $a^e = 1$;
	\item $a^{e'} = 0$ for other short edges $e'$.
	\item $\sum_{e' \in E} a^{e'} = 0$ (follows directly from $u_e \in K_c$)
\end{itemize}


Let us first suppose we have constructed such $u_e$,
and show that these properties ensure that
$\{\Theta_*(u_e)\}_{e\in E}$ spans an $|E|-1$ dimensional space.
This is a simple exercise in linear algebra,
but we show it for completeness.


Put the $\Theta_*(u_e)$'s into a $E \times E$ matrix,
denoted $M$,
so that the $e$-th row corresponds to $\Theta_*(u_e)$.
By virtue of $u_e \in K_c$, we have that $(1\; 1\; \cdots \; 1)^T$
is in the null space of $M$;
our goal is to show that it spans the null space.


Suppose $b = (b_e)^T$ is in the null space of $M$.
Reorder $E$, if necessary, so that long edges come before
short edges.
Then by the last property of $u_e$'s for long edges,
the top right block of long-by-short entries are 0.
Thus the vector $b_\llong := (b_e)_{e \in \llong}^T$ is in the null space
of the submatrix $M_\llong$ of long-by-long entries.


Let $|b_e|$ be the largest among components of $b_\llong$;
rescale $b$ so that $b_e = 1$.
The $e$-th component of $M_\llong b_\llong$
is $1 - \sum_{e' \neq e} a^{e'} b_{e'}$,
where $a^{e'}$ are the components of $\Theta_*(u_e)$.
Since $\sum_{e' \neq e} |a^{e'}| = 1$, this can be 0 if and only if
for all $e'$ with $a^{e'} < 0$, we have exactly $b_{e'} = 1$.
By connectedness of $G_\llong$, this implies
$b_\llong = (1 \; \cdots \; 1)^T$.


Returning to the full $M$, it is now easy to see that
for a short edge $e$,
by looking at the $e$-th row of $M$,
we have $b_e = \sum a^{e'} = 1$,
so we are done.

%\footnote{
%This is a well-known argument/result about graph Laplacians:
%the first two properties of $u_e$'s ensure that
%$-M_\llong^T$ is essentially a graph Laplacian for $G_\llong$,
%so has rank = (\#vertices) - (\#components).}


Now we construct the $u_e$'s.
First suppose that $e$ is a long edge between two convex faces $f, f'$
(so $\vec{e} \in \del f, \cev{e} \in \del f'$).
Observe that $\alpha_e$ from \eqnref{e:alpha_e}
increases $\Phi_f$ and $\Phi_{f'}$,
and we can compensate using $\beta_f$ from \eqnref{e:beta_f_convex},
so we consider
\[
w_e = \alpha_e - \frac{1}{\cos \vphi_{\vec{e}}} \beta_f
	- \frac{1}{\cos \vphi_{\cev{e}}} \beta_{f'} \in K_c
\]
%Since $\theta_e = \pi - \vphi_{\vec{e}} - \vphi_{\cev{e}}$,
%we need to show that the coefficients of $\ddd{\vphi_{\vec{e}}},
%\ddd{\vphi_{\cev{e}}}$ sum to 0.
For $\vec{e'} \in \del f \cup \del f' \backslash \{\vec{e},\cev{e}\}$,
the $\ddd{\vphi_{\vec{e'}}}$ component only appears in $\beta_f$
or $\beta_{f'}$, which is positive by construciton
(this requires $f,f'$ to be convex faces);
thus, $d\theta_{e'}(w_e) \geq 0$ for such $e'$, and
is equal to 0 if and only if $e'$ is short.
Finally, since $w_e \in K_c$, it leaves the sum $\sum_{e\in E} \theta_e$
constant, so $d\theta_e(w_e) < 0$, so we can take
\begin{equation}
\label{e:u_e}
u_e := (d\theta_e(w_e))^\inv \cdot w_e
\end{equation}

In general, we consider a wide path of faces $f_0, \ldots, f_n$,
such that all faces except $f_0$ and $f_n$ are thin,
and $f_i$ are distinct except possibly $f_0 = f_n$.
\footnote{Picture a closed accordian.}
Let $e_i$ be the long edge between $f_i$ and $f_{i+1}$,
and orient so that $\vec{e_i} \in \del f_i$, $\cev{e_i} \in \del f_{i+1}$.


We will construct $u_{e_i}$ for $i = 1,\ldots,n$.


We want to increase the lengths of $e_i$'s all together.
Let $E' = \{\vec{e_i}, \cev{e_i} | i=0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$.
Consider
\[
x :=
\sum_{i=0,\ldots,n-1} \alpha_{e_i}
=
\sum_{\vec{e} \in E'}
\frac{1}{2 r_{f_{\vec{e}}} \cos \vphi_{\vec{e}}} \ddd{\vphi_{\vec{e}}}
%\sum_{\substack{i = 0,\ldots, n-1 \\ \vec{e} = \vec{e_i}, \cev{e_i} }}
%\frac{1}{2 r_{f_0} \cos \vphi_{\vec{e_0}}} \ddd{\vphi_{\vec{e_0}}}
%+
%\frac{1}{2 r_{f_n} \cos \vphi_{\cev{e_{n-1}}}} \ddd{\vphi_{\cev{e_{n-1}}}}
%+
\]
with $\alpha_e$ from \eqnref{e:alpha_e}.
It is clear that $x$ increases all oriented $e_i$ lengths
$l_{\vec{e}}$ equally fast,
i.e. $dl_{\vec{e_i}}(x) = dl_{\cev{e_i}}(x) = 1/2$ for all $i$,
so $x\in T_c \CCC$.
It is also clear that for the thin faces $f_i$,
$x$ makes one of the angles $\vphi_{\cev{e_{i-1}}}, \vphi_{\vec{e_i}}$
increase and the other decrease, both at the same rate,
thus $d\Phi_{f_i}(x) = 0$.
However, the vector $x$ increase $\Phi_{f_0}$ and $\Phi_{f_n}$,
so it is compensated using $\beta_f$'s, so that
\[
y := x - \frac{1}{r_{f_0} \cos \vphi_{\vec{e_0}}} \beta_{f_0}
- \frac{1}{r_{f_n} \cos \vphi_{\cev{e_{n-1}}}} \beta_{f_n}
\in K_c
\]
Before we modify $y$ to give the desired $u_{e_i}$,
we note that for $\vec{e} \in (\cup \del f_i) \backslash E'$,
the $\vphi_{\vec{e}}$-component in $y$ is non-positive,
and is 0 if and only if $e$ is short;
so $\Theta_*(-y)$ already satisfies three of the four properties
desired in $\Theta_*(u_e)$.


Recall that for thin face $f$,
$\alpha_f$ from \eqnref{e:alpha_f} is in $K_c$,
and we have
\[
\Theta_*(\frac{r_{f_i}}{\tan \vphi_{\vec{e_i}}} \alpha_{f_i}) = 
	\ddd{\theta_{e_i}} - \ddd{\theta_{e_{i-1}}}
\]
Write $\bar{\alpha}_{f_i} = \frac{r_{f_i}}{\tan \vphi_{\vec{e_i}}} \alpha_{f_i}$.
Then it is easy to see that using $\bar{\alpha}_{f_i}$'s, we can
``push around'' the $\theta_{e_i}$-components in $\Theta_*(y)$
so only one is nonzero.
More precisely, if
$\Theta_*(y) = \sum_e y^e \ddd{\theta_e}$, the image under $\Theta_*$
of the vector
\[
\bar{u}_{e_0} := y - y^{e_{n-1}} \bar{\alpha}_{f_{n-1}}
- (y^{e_{n-2}} + y^{e_{n-1}}) \bar{\alpha}_{f_{n-2}}
- \ldots
- (y^{e_1} + \ldots + y^{e_{n-1}}) \bar{\alpha}_{f_1}
\]
would have $\theta_{e_i}$-components 0 for all $i$ except 0;
for $i=0$, the $\theta_{e_0}$-component is now $y^{e_0} + \ldots + y^{e_{n-1}}$,
which is nonzero because $\sum_{e'\in E} y^{e'} = 0$
and $\sum_{e' \in E \backslash E'} y^{e'} > 0$.
Therefore, we can take
\[
u_{e_0} := (d\theta_{e_0}(\bar{u}_{e_0}))^\inv \cdot \bar{u}_{e_0};
\;\;\;
u_{e_i} = u_{e_{i-1}} + \bar{\alpha}_{f_i}
\]

We still need to show the collective connectivity property of the $u_e$'s.
It is easy to see that the long edges of a convex face
are connected in $G_\llong$
(for example, $u_{e_0}$ defined above clearly does it for
$f_0$).
Furthermore, all the $\Theta_*(u_{e_i})$ have most components equal,
so $e_i$ are in the same connected component of $G_\llong$.
Thus connectivity of $G_\llong$ follows from the
wide-path-connectivity of faces.


Finally, for short edges $e$, we simply define $u_e$
as in \eqnref{e:u_e}
(here we do not worry about whether faces are thin or convex,
as the non-positivity condition of $a^{e'}$ is absent).
\end{proof}
