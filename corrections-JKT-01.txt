First, why must the augmented components be in the direction ...
-we now include the other case in the main theorem (Thm 3.4)

Second, could you explain what the problem is with bigons? ...
-we point out the use of bigon conditions in second paragraph of proof of Thm 3.4

Further, what if you start with a projection that is not weakly prime...
-we address this in the remark at the end of the paper.

errata/suggestions:
1 10 We explained twist-reduced in Section 2
1 11 added "in": We point out that in [7]


pg 5 Figure 4 referenced in Def 2.11

pg 6 yes, "We also add three horizontal edges.."

pg 6 yes, weird latex issue




Other changes:
-added Figure 4 for clarity
-separated definition of twist-reduced from definition of twist-region
